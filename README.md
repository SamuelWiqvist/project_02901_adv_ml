# Project work for *02901 Advanced Topics in Machine Learning: Computational Tools for Machine Learning in Python*

Reaanalyses of the MA2 process example in *Learning Summary Statistic for Approximate Bayesian Computation via Deep Neural Network* [link to paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282691910_Learning_Summary_Statistic_for_Approximate_Bayesian_Computation_via_Deep_Neural_Network).

### Software

All calculations are computed in a Laptop with an Intel® Core™ i7-6600U CPU @ 2.60GHz × 4 CPU running Ubuntu 16.04.

The code is written in Python 3.6.5.

Packages used:

* `PyTorch` v0.4.1
* `Numpy` v1.14.3
* `Statsmodels` v0.9.0
* `Matplotlib` v2.2.2
